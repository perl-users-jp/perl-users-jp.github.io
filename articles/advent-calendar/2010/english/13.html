        <h1>Using DBI Callbacks</h1>

        <p>Have you ever used DBI's "Callbacks" (and "ChildCallbacks") attribute? Say we have a code like this:</p>

    <pre class="code prettyprint lang-perl">#!perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use DBI;
use Time::Piece;

my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect(&#39;dbi:SQLite::memory:&#39;);
$dbh-&gt;do(&#39;create table foo (id, created_at)&#39;);

my $insert = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&#39;insert into foo values(?, ?)&#39;);
my $select = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&#39;select created_at from foo where id = ?&#39;);

$insert-&gt;execute(1, Time::Piece-&gt;new);
$select-&gt;execute(1);
print $select-&gt;fetchrow_array;</pre>
<p>You'll get something like "Wed Dec 15 22:59:20 2010" when you run it. It might be okay for you, but I usually don't want to store such a datetime string; I want it to be converted into an epoch time for simplicity.</p><p>The "Callbacks" attribute helps in such cases. You can register a callback function (which will be executed before its corresponding method) to a database handler, or to a statement handler, like this:</p>

    <pre class="code prettyprint lang-perl">(snip)

my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect(&#39;dbi:SQLite::memory:&#39;);
$dbh-&gt;do(&#39;create table foo (id, created_at)&#39;);

$dbh-&gt;{Callbacks}{ChildCallbacks}{execute} = sub {
    for (@_) { $_ = $_-&gt;epoch if ref $_ eq &#39;Time::Piece&#39; }
    return;
};

(snip)</pre>
<p>Here I register a callback for an "execute" method of all the child statement handles through "ChildCallbacks". You can set a callback directly to a specific statement handle, or you can set callbacks when you connect (through the fourth argument where you often set "AutoCommit" and "RaiseError" attributes). See DBI's pod for details.</p><p>Now you can retrieve an epoch time. But you might want it to be a Time::Piece object when you retrieve.</p><p>I usually don't think it a good idea to turn a scalar value from a database into an arbitrary object by default. I'd probably add another method to inflate to DBI::st (or specific driver's ::st) class for casual use (don't do that in a serious $job application, though), or, write a plain model class and do necessary inflation there, which I think much better.</p>

    <pre class="code prettyprint lang-perl">(snip)

no warnings &#39;once&#39;;
*DBI::st::fetchrow_array_inflated = sub {
    my $sth = shift;
    my @got = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_array;

    my @cols = @{$sth-&gt;{NAME_lc} || []};
    for (0 .. $#cols) {
        $got[$_] = Time::Piece-&gt;new($got[$_]) if $cols[$_] =~ /_at$/;
    }
    return @got;
};

(snip)</pre>
<p>You might possibly be able to do it through "Callbacks", but as of this writing, there seems something wrong or picky, and I couldn't find a way to do it properly. It's not so cool either to override all of the fetch*/select* methods. If all you want is just a date/time string to embed into a template, you might want to use some built-in SQL function to convert an epoch time to a date/time string. See appropriate documentation for details.</p>

    <pre class="code prettyprint lang-perl">(snip)

my $select = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&#39;select datetime(created_at, &#34;unixepoch&#34;) from foo where id = ?&#39;);
