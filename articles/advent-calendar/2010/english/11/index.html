        <h1>Sub::Throttle - a tiny module for throttling down an operation</h1>

        <p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Sub-Throttle/">Sub::Throttle</a> is a tiny module that is useful for throttling down the load of a certain operation.  For example, it can be used to limit the speed of a batch operation against a database so that other operations (such as requests from the web application) would not slow down too much.</p><p>It is easy to modify an existing operation (a for-loop in the case of the example below) to use Sub::Throttle.  The example limits the load factor 0.1, i.e. the loop will be delayed 9x the time it took for performing a single operation, effectively limiting the load of the operation to 1/10.</p>

    <pre class="code prettyprint lang-perl"># BEFORE

for (...) {
    # the operation
    ...
}</pre>

    <pre class="code prettyprint lang-perl"># AFTER

use Sub::Throttle qw(throttle);

my $load = 0.1;

for (...) {
    throttle($load, sub {
        # the operation
        ...
    });
}</pre>
