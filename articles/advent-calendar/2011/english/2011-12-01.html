    <p>At CPAN, DBIx:: namespace is used for many useful extension modules of DBI. Sometimes skilled Perl programmer prefer to use raw DBI instead of O/R mapper. However they use some DBIx:: modules because of lack of DBI function. If you are looking for modules that provides useful features, this track will help you.</p>
